## 🟢 Priority 1: Data Synchronization & Live Logic

    - Implement `Medicine.get_low_stock_count()` integration for the dashboard.
- [ ] **Inventory-Sale Lifecycle**:
    - Verify `Medicine.update_stock` successfully decrements quantities in the database.
    - Implement a Signal/Slot or callback system to refresh the Inventory and Dashboard views immediately after a sale is completed in the [BillingWindow](file:///c:/Users/Pc/OneDrive/Desktop/MediTrack/gui/billing_window.py#153-539).
